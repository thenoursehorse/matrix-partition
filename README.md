# matrix-partition

Automatically partition a matrix into a block diagonal form with respect to 
symmetries.

Dependencies
-------------
* numpy
* scipy
* (Optional) networkx, which makes the merge list sort faster.

Installation
---------------
```
python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
```


To do
---------------
1. docstrings for member functions.
1. The connections, sectors, and permutations need to be stored for each 
symmetry that is applied.
1. Implement function to rotate a state into the final permutation and basis 
after applying symmetry.
1. Other useful types of plots.

Examples
---------------
* Ising chain into parity sectors.
* XXZ spin-1/2 chain into SU(2), and parity sectors.
